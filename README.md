# Unicode Font Coverage 

This is a personal script used to check the Unicode font coverage. 
It prints the [Unicode block](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt) covered by the font and the corresponding characters.


## Usage

1. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the script with the path to your font file:
```
python check.py /path/to/font.ttf
```
